# Apollonius - An Apollonius' problem-solver written in Java

This is a port of the core of my "[Inversion][]" app to Java.
It doesn't give proper results yet. - I don't know why...

A quick introduction to the problem of Apollonius:
> The task of this geometrical problem is to construct all circles (or lines) that are tangent to ("touch") three circles (or a point / line).
Now this may sound easy, but try to do this with three points, which is the kind of the most easy one. You'll soon find out it isn't that easy. But if you use something called "inversion" (not the app), it's very easy. Inversion is sometimes also called "mirroring in a circle" (at least in German), which explains the concept very well (google for it if you want).
